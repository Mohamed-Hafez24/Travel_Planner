## APIs
In this project I am using three APIs :
- [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
- [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev)
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)
To make sure that the project will work with you correctly. You need to register to these APIs and get your credential Keys. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Run the project
There is two environments (Mode) setup for this project:

> Development environment(Mode)
if you are going to apply some changes to the project and want the server to automatically re-build the application and reloads the page.
So you should use this command:
- `npm run build-dev` 
and it will open a new window in your browser with the app running on `localhost:3300`

> Production environment(Mode)
if you are going to run the project for production (with express server). 
So you should use these commands:
```
npm run build-prod
npm run start
```
and it will open a new window in your browser with the app running locally on port `localhost:7000`

## Project Testing
This project uses the Jest framework that provides us the ability to create, and run tests.
So you should use this command to run  testing:
- `npm run test`
