# APIs
In this project I am using three APIs :
- [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
- [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev)
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)

# Run the project
There is two environments (Mode) setup for this project:

> Development environment(Mode)
if you are going to apply some changes to the project and want the server to automatically re-build the application and reloads the page.
So you should use this command:
- `npm run build-dev` 
and it will open a new window in your browser with the app running on `localhost:3300`

> Production environment(Mode)
if you are going to run the project for production (with express server). 
So you should use these commands:
- `npm run build-prod` 
- `npm run start`
and it will open a new window in your browser with the app running on `localhost:8000`

Now you can enter your text in the input form or the URL for the article or blog you want to analyze.

# Project Testing
